# LostAdriftProject
My project for IMS465 and IMS445. Since I made my game in Unreal Engine 5, I was unable to successfully import the game due to some of the large file sizes in the project. So I have a link to the full project including the packaged version as a zip folder that you can download and examine.

Link to the folder with my project in it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jl8rGb-OehZW8M5DzbsTghtHzTCYrYig/view?usp=sharing
